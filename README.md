PURPOSE OF PROJECT: CSIS225 HW3 Assignment

This is a text based version of the game Hoppers.  It is essentially a peg solitaire game that is played with frog pieces instead of generic pegs.  The purpose is to find a solution that jumps all the frogs and removes them and leaves the solitary red frog on the board.
